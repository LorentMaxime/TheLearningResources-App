# TheLearningResources-App
A simple app to store learning resources

## How to use it ?
If you want to run my code, you need to follow these steps:
1. Run npm install in the extracted project folder to install all required dependencies => This
will create a node_modules folder which is missing otherwise (it's not in the attachment because that would bloat the ZIP file)
2. Run npm run serve to bring up the development server, view the app at localhost:8080
(or whichever port is shown in your terminal)

## What is the purpose of it ?
In fact, this a dummy simple Vue3 app I made to train myself on Vue3 specifics options. <br>
I wanted an app with two tabs, a form to add new resources, a button to delete a resource, a header. No DB, just cached in browser memory.<br>
My goal:  to put into practice some of Vue options : <br>
- the "Provide / Inject" option<br>
- the use of pattern and approach of reusable component with "slot" <br>
- of course what Vue is all about: breaking code into components!<br>
<br>The way I made the app sticks to this goal.
